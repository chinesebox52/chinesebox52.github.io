              <img src="./resources/images/hutong.jpg" alt="an image of hutong" />
              <p>We are located in a Hutong called, Xi Si Bei Er Tiao. Hutong means a narrow alleyway, often positioned like a maze. Before development took place in Beijing, Hutongs used to be everywhere. Not to worry, there are still plenty of Hutongs around Beijing, which are the best choice if you want to just walk around, get lost, while experiencing the Real Beijing and its people, taking a walk, talking with the neighbours.</p>

              <p>The photos above were taken in Fall of Beijing, except for the night photo (I think that was in Summer). Two days after the photo was taken, the yellow leaves all fell and in no time Winter came! This is the first thing you can see when you open the gate. A small yard, and on the left, behind the white chair, is the reception. That person in blue is Echo. I asked her to sit there so she's sitting there awkwardly. Hi Echo!</p>

              <p>Hi, this is the reception, and that's me! But it is very unlikely that you will be greeted by us when you first arrive here and our funny smiles (Lee and Jason from the left). We are usually sleeping... Anyway, this is the reception area, where you can check-in / -out and ask any questions about Beijing.</p>

                <img src="./resources/images/keting2.jpg" alt="Hostel public area image" />

                <img src="./resources/images/keting3.jpg" alt="Hostel public area image" />

              </div>
              <p>This is one of the public areas, it is right next to the reception. Guests can use this area freely! Look at the second photo, with the sleeping guy. He's pretending to be thinking about sth very important, but in reality he and I had just seen giant dildos on the internet by accident (really), so he's trying to recover from it. Or maybe he's just thinking about them... He's Jacob and he was our guest. He arrived at 2 am and because it was too late he did not want to wake us up and instead he tried to stay outside until the morning, or the death. A very nice guy. But fortunately, I heard someone outside like a magic, so I let him in and saved his life (it was really cold). And man, he kept coming back here for like one year! We had so much fun together though. He's actually the second guest who kept coming back and just live here. I was the first one... And there is another room next to this, which is also a public area. We call it the Tea room because it has all the tea stuffs, and a really nice table for tea!</p>
