              <img src="./resources/images/hutong.jpg" alt="an image of hutong" />
              <p>We are located in a Hutong called, Xi Si Bei Er Tiao. Hutong means a narrow alleyway, often positioned like a maze. Before the massive development took place in Beijing, Hutongs used to be everywhere, which means all the more fun for tourists! Not to worry, there are still plenty of Hutongs around Beijing, which are the best places to go to if you want a slow day, just walking around, getting lost (please come home), while experiencing the Real Beijing and observing its people taking a walk, talking with the neighbours with the tourists' eyes.</p>

              <p>The photos above were taken in Fall of Beijing, except for the night photo (I think that was in Summer). Two days after the photo was taken, the yellow leaves all fell and in no time Winter came! This is the first thing you can see when you open the front doors of our hostel. A small yard, and on the left, behind the white chair, is the reception. That person in blue is Echo. I asked her to sit there and be a model so she's sitting there awkwardly. Hi Echo!</p>

              <p>Hi, this is the reception, and that's Lee and Jason (me) from the Left! But it is very unlikely that you will be greeted by us and our funny smiles when you first arrive here, because we are usually sleeping during the day.. See you guys in the night! Anyway, this is the reception area, where you can check-in / -out and ask <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> questions about Beijing.</p>

              </div>
              <p>This is one of the public areas, it is right next to the reception. Guests can use this area freely! Look at the second photo, with the sleeping guy. He's a philosopher pretending to be thinking about sth very important, but in reality he and I had just seen giant dildos on the internet by accident (really), so he's trying to recover from that visual surprise(?). Or maybe he's just thinking about them... He's Jacob and he was our guest. He arrived at 2 am and because it was too late, he did not want to wake us up to check him in, so instead he decided to stay outside until the morning comes. A very nice guy. But fortunately, I heard someone outside (one of many talents you need to make a great hostel person), so I let him in and saved his <span style="font-size: 12px; text-decoration: line-through;">ass</span> life (it was really cold). And man, he kept coming back here for like one year! We had so much fun together though. He's actually the second guest who kept coming back, and just live here (I was the first one).. Lol! And there is another room next to this, which is also a public area. We call it the Tea room because it has all the tea stuffs, and a really nice table for tea!

                These last four photos are just some photos in and around the hostel in snow. You can see some other photos, for example that of our rooms, on the major booking websites! Also, if you have any other questions, just shoot us an email! We'll reply in no time. Last but not least, here is a beautiful photo of Beijing :).
